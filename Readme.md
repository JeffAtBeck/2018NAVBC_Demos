This set of extensions is built based on Freddy K's Hackathon Workshop run at Directions NA (Oct. 2018)

Freddy's first challenge was posted for NAVUG Focus 2018 (URL: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/freddyk/2018/05/16/a-new-learning-opportunity-the-hackathon-at-navug-focus-18/)

See the HackathonChallenges subfolder for PDF versions of each of the "challenges" (there are 5 additional ones to the one he posted above).  The main challenge is just inside it's related subfolder and the solution PDFs are all inside a "Solutions" subfolder (just in case you want to peek a head or get stuck).  Note that these solution PDFs are all password protected so you can't just jump right into them, the passwords are listed at the bottom of each challenge for their related solution PDF.
